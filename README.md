# ML
Machine learning scripts: regression, classification, clustering, association rule learning, reinforcement learning, etc.
Sammcvety here, I'm a PhD student and taco lover who is usually in the lab or on a backcountry hike. 
This is a project to document useful ML algorithms on python for later use.
